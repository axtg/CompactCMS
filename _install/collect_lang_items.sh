# scan the entire CCMS codebase and create a file listing all the language text items 
# (which expect translation, of course).
#
# next, compare this list with the existing translation files and add the missing entries
# to them, where applicable.

#
# The 'collect_lang_items.sh' script is handy to test/update the language files in 
# ./lib/languages/ : it scans the entire CCMS source tree and detects which 
# $ccms['lang'][etc.etc.] multilingual item references exist in there, then checks 
# this set against each of the language files, e.g. lib/languages/de.inc.php and 
# writes a code block like shown below to that file, so the translator can see which 
# entries still must be done.
# It's also handy as a semi-auto way to update language files while the CCMS is further 
# developed (and possibly new $ccms['lang'][...] entries are introduced.
#

#
# first, collect all the source files:
#

# we assume we're starting from the _install directory.
# ... we can dump temp files in there as, after installation, the entire directory
#     is to be 'rm -rf'-ed anyhow, so we won't clutter the CCMS code tree, while
#     we run this or other UNIX shell scripts during development.
pushd ./

echo collecting data...

# the pipe by lines:
#   1: list all files, except the language files themselves of course.
#      also ignore any cache or media files: those are there for download/use
#      only and are NOT part of the CCMS code (if /media files are, we've a bother anyway)
#   2: grep all the code lines which have 1 OR MORE language text references in them
#   3: chop lines up before the $ and after several combos at the end of a ccms[lang][x][y]
#      statement as they exist out there. This is written so that we NOT require ccms[a][b][c]
#      triple index levels; it's rather more flexible.
#      UNFORTUNATELY, some $ccms['lang'] entries have PHP code in their index, so those get
#      corrupted. Currently this applies to ['lang']['menu'][$coded_index_something] only.
#      ALSO split at the ':' at the end of the filepath printed by grep.
#   4: take this newline-riddled feed and extract the only two things we want to hear about:
#      /where/, i.e. the filepaths which grep reported, and the $ccms[] entries themselves
#   5: gawk will 'fake' those nuked ['lang]['menu'][$coded!] entries, plus make sure
#      each entry gets prefixed by the filepath where it was dup up by grep.
#      Doing it in this multistage pipeline ensures this keeps working for code lines with
#      MULTIPLE $ccms['lang'] references!
#      BTW: The qt=39 + %c thingy is necessary because getting single quotes in a single-quote
#      delimited awk inline script turned ugly; this was the easier cop-out there.
#   6: standard phrase to uniquify the output and dump it to a log file, where we like to
#      see each line with both path and $ccms['lang'] entry.
#   7: next, we're stripping away those ../path/file: prefixes as we only want the $ccms['lang']
#      entries by now.
#   8: again uniquify them and dump to file. THIS list will be used to check the /lib/languages/*
#      files against!
